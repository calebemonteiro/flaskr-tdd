# Flaskr-tdd - My very First Web application.

Hello everyone,

My name is Calebe Monteiro and i'm a mainframe specialist mainly focused in COBOL/JCL/CICS (Batch - Online) applications. For the past 2 weeks i've been searching around to learn a new technology that allows me not only learning something fun and new but also to empower my tech(ish) knowledge. I've always saw tweets from a girl that went to college with me (you can check her work on [@paulagrangeiro](https://twitter.com/paulagrangeiro) and http://paulagrangeiro.com.br/) talking about Python and Django (at first, i though that was about the tarantino [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/)) Then after google for about 5 minutes i've discovered that Python is a versatile language widely used for inumerous applications. So, here i am after 2 weeks of intense studying i was able to finish the tutorial from official Flask webpage [tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/) and [Michael Herman's](https://github.com/mjhea0) (also based in flask official tutorial) applying my own small tweaks, which for me was a big accomplishment.
